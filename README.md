ðŸ“º Netflix Sign-Up Clone

A front-end clone of the Netflix sign-up flow built using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.  
This project aims to recreate the sleek, modern UI/UX of Netflix's onboarding experience, focusing on responsiveness, styling, and interactivity.

ðŸš§ Project Status

This project is **currently in progress**. Iâ€™ve completed the homepage, and Iâ€™m actively working on building out all the additional pages, including:

- Plan selection
- Payment options 
- Payment screens for card, paypal, giftcode and mobile bill

Iâ€™ll be uploading new code and updates daily as I progress through each part of the sign-up flow.
